6.872 Cancer Prognosis Final Project

This project was designed to help doctors have an easy way to determine the prognosis for a patient based on a specific set of cancer information. We would also like to assist the doctor in the interactions with the patients as many patients are not necessarily presented with relevant prognostic information.
